Kulupu is a blockchain run by the community. As a result, many tasks need to be handled in a decentralized and distributed manner. This is the page to coordinate different tasks that is to be done on Kulupu for short-to-mid-term. For long-term visions, please see [Roadmap of Kulupu](https://consensus.corepaper.org/wiki/Roadmap_of_Kulupu).

Please feel free to add any new task or edit descriptions of existing tasks.

Right now doing those tasks are entirely voluntary. After implementation of voluntary taxation, Kulupu's on-chain governance body treasury may be able to provide funding to finish each of the tasks that it deems important. 

## Task overview

See [issues](https://github.com/kulupu/coordination/issues) page for the complete list of current available coordinating tasks.
